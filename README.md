# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide.  
This project aims to **predict the risk of diabetes** in a patient based on clinical and lifestyle features using **Machine Learning classification models**.

The system can help in **early detection**, enabling preventive care and better lifestyle decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a person is at **risk of diabetes** based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and other health indicators.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains patient health information including:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age  
- **Target Variable**:  
  - `0` → No Diabetes  
  - `1` → Diabetes

📌 Missing values are handled using appropriate imputation strategies.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🔍 Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
